# Installation

UCR is really easy to install as it's an **EXILED** plugin.

In order to install UCR you need to download the `UncomplicatedCustomRoles.dll` file from the [UCR latest release](https://github.com/UncomplicatedCustomServer/UncomplicatedCustomRoles/releases/latest) and put the file inside the folder `.config/EXILED/Plugins/`.

You may need to install the UCR's only dependency, **Newtonsoft.Json** and if you need to then download from the [UCR latest release](https://github.com/UncomplicatedCustomServer/UncomplicatedCustomRoles/releases/latest) the file `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` and put it inside the `.config/EXILED/Plugin/dependencies` folder.

After this you simply need to **completely restart the SCP:SL Server** in order to allow UCR to enable itself.
