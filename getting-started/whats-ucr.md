# What's UCR

**UCR** or **UncomplicatedCustomRoles** is a free open-source plugin for **EXILED** (SCP:Secret Laboratory) that allow server owners to create **highly-customizable Custom Roles** with a simple YAML configuration.

With our powerful tool you have the chance to customize even more your server without having to learn how to develop EXILED plugins nor to pay a developer lots of money!

UCR has lots of key features such as:\
\- **Unlimited number of Custom Roles**\
&#x20;  You can create how manu Custom Roles you want without any limitation from us!\
&#x20;  The only limitation is your creativity!\
\- **Custom Roles configurations are in different files**\
&#x20;  Custom Roles YAML configuration are one per file: you can organize them as you prefer.\
&#x20;  You can also put Custom Roles configuration files inside sub-folders in order to get more order!\
&#x20;\- **Exhaustive wiki**\
&#x20;  We always try to provide the best documentation both for our server owners and developers.\
\- **Active community on Discord**\
&#x20;  Our official Discord community is really active and always willing to help everyone with their problems with UCR.\
&#x20;  We also have a special section for server owners where warnings, teasers and pre-releases are shared in advance!\
\- **Fully customizable Custom Roles**\
&#x20;  With UCR you can configure almost every aspect of the role in order to reach your goal.\
\- **User-friendly in-game commands**\
&#x20;  With our newer version of UCR, `v7.0.0`, we have completly reworked the command system.\
