# Overview

**UncomplicatedCustomRoles**, such as every other complex product on the market has a complete command system with lots of useful commands.

In this part of the documentation we'll see their utility, their required permissions and what they do.

If you need to see in-game a **complete list of commands** we invite you to execute in the Remote Admin (RA) the command `ucr`.

## Command Syntax

We use a Minecraft-like way to describe the syntax of a command.

We use `<>` to indicate a **needed value** while we use `()` to indicate an **optional value**.

We use `|` or `/` to separate what you can use for that value.

For example, `<Player Id/Player Nickname> (Message)` does tell you that the Player Id **OR** the Player Name is required while the Message is **optional**.
