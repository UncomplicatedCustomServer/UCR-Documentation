# Migrate

If you want to change the port of your SCP:SL server but you want to keep your Spawn Points you need to migrate them as they are port-based (linked to both the IP and the port of the server).

### Syntax

```
ucr spawnpoints migrate <New Port>
```

### Description

Migrate your Spawn Points from your current port to another one.

**Note:** if you change the server and therefore the IP you need to contact us to migrate also the IP!
