# Percentages

The Spawn behavior of UCR is completely based on **Percentages**: each role has a defined percentage of replacing a vanilla one and if you start to have lots of Custom Roles is quite difficult to keep an eye on every percentage.

Because of that we've created the **Percentages** command that will display the Custom Role and the Vanilla spawn percentages for each vanilla role.

### Syntax

```
ucr percentages (details)
```

### Permission

```
ucr.percentages
```

### Description

Show the spawn chance of every Custom Role for each vanilla role.

If you put `details` as the second arg you'll see also each Custom Role that can replace the given vanilla role.
