# Errors

Lots of times you'll encounter YAML Errors that will prevent your role from being loaded.

Since `v6.0.0` UCR does track every not loaded role but since `v7.0.0` there's a specific command where you can see which roles were not loaded, the reason and some suggestion(s) for fixing it.

### Syntax

```
ucr errors
```

### Permission

```
ucr.errors
```

### Description

See every not loaded Custom Role due to an error.
