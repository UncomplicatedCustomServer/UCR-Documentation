# SpawnPoint

**UCR** offers to server owners a powerful tool to customize even more the spawn location for their Custom Roles.\
With the **SpawnPoint** feature you can decide a precise position in a precise room where the Custom Role will spawn and no matter if the seed changes: the position will be always the same (in the room)!

The **SpawnPoint** command, due to its complexity, has some sub-commands that are available in the sub-pages.
