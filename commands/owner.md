# Owner

**UncomplicatedCustomServer Collective** supports server owners that use their products and because of this there are some perks for them in our Discord Server.

In order to access to the Server Owner section (called Owners Plaza) you have to get the role `@Server Owner` and via this command is the only way.\
You can get the role only if your server is **a verified server online on the official list**.

### Syntax

```
ucr owner <Discord Id>
```

### Permission

```
ucr.owner
```

### Description

Get the Server Owner role on the UCSC official Discord server.
